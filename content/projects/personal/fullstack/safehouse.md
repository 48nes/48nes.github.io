[Safehou-se](https://safehou-se.vercel.app) is a simple web application I built in a two day sprint. The project involved creating Template objects from a user given code template input (after sanitizing the input, of course), which could then be filled in by the user through inputs rather than having to go through the entire code themselves.

The project is an update on an old prototype created by [Carter](https://github.com/darling), known as [Bruhhouse](https://bruhhouse.vercel.app). 

On November 4, 2022, another feature was added to the site to add inline color styling to templates. This feature was built in a one day sprint.
