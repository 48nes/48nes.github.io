The Eggitor image editor was our final pair programming assignment for Object Oriented Design.

Above is a video demo of our editor's features, including:

- Blurring a photo
- Sharpening a photo
- Applying a sepia filter onto a photo
- Applying a grayscale filter onto a photo
- Creating a checkerboard pattern
- Applying a mosaic filter onto a photo

Also demonstrated is our editor's layers feature, with visibility toggles and selection toggles. 

This project is currently in a private repository. If you would like a full demonstration of features, please shoot me an email at [agnesshan@live.com](mailto:agnesshan@live.com).
