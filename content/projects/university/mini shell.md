### Project Description
For this project, a mini shell was implemented using C. The shell supported all functions for both shortcut and full path, for example, `ls` and `/bin/ls` are both acceptable commands. A few built-in commands, `cd`, `source`, `prev`, and `help` are also available.

Additionally, sequencing, input and output redirection, and pipes are all supported in the mini shell.
