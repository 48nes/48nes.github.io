Flood It was one of the pair programming projects done in Fundamentals of Computer Science 2.

Above is a video demo of a Flood It game being played. One of our main features in implementing this game is the waterfall delay effect used when "flooding" a box.

This project is currently in a private repository. If you would like a full demonstration of features, please shoot me an email at [agnesshan@live.com](mailto:agnesshan@live.com).
