The Maze project was our final pair programming project for Fundamentals of Computer Science 2. 

Above is a video demo of our maze being solved using a DFS algorithm. Additional features include:

- Use of Kruskal's Algorithm for maze creation
- Click to finish rendering for maze creation
- End to start path highlighting
- Toggle between BFS/DFS/Manual (not shown)

This project is currently in a private repository. If you would like a full demonstration of features, please shoot me an email at [agnesshan@live.com](mailto:agnesshan@live.com).
