### Project Description
For this project, I implemented a simple calculator supporting the four basic mathematic operations: +, -, *, and /, in Assembly using AT&T syntax. 

The project was executable by running the function `./calculator` followed by an operator and then the two numbers to perform the operation on. It is notable that th `/` function would provide only the quotient and not the remainder.
