8byte Widgets are the name I've given to a set of small web apps I've built for use on the site [Toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se). The site is written in Python and built using the [Flask framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/). It is currently hosted through [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).

The Toyhou.se Like Counter is a dynamic web app that allows toyhou.se users to check how many likes their characters have accumulated in total. 

### Character Generator

The Random Character Generator allows users to generate a random character in a folder by giving the folder link. The app works for both personal folders and group folders.

### Previews

All widgets are currently live at [eightbyte-widgets.herokuapp.com](https://eightbyte-widgets.herokuapp.com).

This project is currently in a private repository.
