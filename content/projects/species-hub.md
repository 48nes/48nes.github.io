Species Hub is meant to serve as a masterlist of all closed, open, and semi-open species and worlds that's easy to navigate and easy to filter through to find the exact community you want to join.

I originally started the project to familiarize myself with the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) framework. The website is written in JavaScript using the framework, with the database handling being done in NoSQL through [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com).

#### Blog Posts

As this was meant to be a learning experience, I've been chronicling my progress with the site on my [web development blog](https://8bytelogs.wordpress.com/).

#### Github Repository

While the current code is private, I do intend on making the repository public once I publish the site.
