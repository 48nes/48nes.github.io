<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>
<p>For this project, I created a very simple client program to communicate with a server, both unencrypted and encrypted with TLS. The end goal of the project was to retrieve a secret flag from the server, after counting the number of times a character appeared in some random string.</p>
<p>The following text is duplicated from the README for this project.</p>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>My approach followed these steps in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a list of all the arguments given</li>
<li>Check for errors with arguments (i.e. less than 2 arguments, port given is incorrect)</li>
<li>Depending on arguments, set port (or keep as default)</li>
<li>Set host and NUID from arguments given</li>
<li>Create a socket</li>
<li>If the <code>-s</code> flag is seen, wraps the socket</li>
<li>Connect the socket to the given host and port</li>
<li>Send the first Hello message</li>
</ol>
<p>After these initial steps, a loop was executed while the server was sending &quot;FIND&quot; messages where:</p>
<ol>
<li>While a newline was not found in the FIND message, the client would wait for more bytes</li>
<li>Once the entire message was read, the FIND string would be split into the <code>character</code> to be found within the <code>search_string</code>. </li>
<li>A built in Python function would count the number of times the character appeared in the String.</li>
<li>The count would be sent to the server.</li>
<li>A new message would be read and checked to see if it was a FIND message, thus continuing the loop.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, once the message given by the server was not a FIND message, the client would print either the secret flag or Unknown_Husky_ID if the ID given was invalid.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Luckily, most of the challenges I faced were (relatively) easily resolved. </p>
<p>The first problem I faced was the original order in which I did things was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the message as bytes</li>
<li>Split the bytes to find the character</li>
<li>Count the number of times that specific byte appeared in the long byte message</li>
</ol>
<p>This led to a lot of difficulty with counting escaped characters, so I ended up changing the order to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the message as bytes</li>
<li>Decode bytes to String</li>
<li>Use the built-in Python function to count the number of times the character appeared</li>
</ol>
<p>The second problem I faced was testing on the Linux servers. This was, luckily, an even quicker fix. I hadn't realized the Linux servers didn't support Python above 3.6.8 and was previously using some 3.7 features (such as <code>with</code> and <code>.SSLContext()</code>).</p>
<p>Both of the above were quick one line fixes to make my client compatible with lower versions of Python. </p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Besides testing the general cases, I also made sure to test:</p>
<ol>
<li>Invalid port given with -p</li>
<li>No port given with -p</li>
<li>-p 27994 with -s</li>
<li>Incorrect NUID</li>
<li>Not enough arguments passed</li>
</ol>
